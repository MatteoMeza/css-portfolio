                    A native of Los Angeles, Matteo was born and raised in Whittier.  He moved to the Pacific Northwest nearly 15 years ago on a dare. Once in the area, he began working in large format graphics and printing and honed his skills across three Portland-based companies. Matteo was drawn to coding due to his detail-oriented personality and appreciation for design. He is currently a student in the U of O Coding Bootcamp and looks forward to taking his knack for problem solving to the next level. When Matteoâ€™s not coding, he relaxes by watching international soccer, recreating the Mexican meals of his childhood, and hanging out with his wife, Sophie, and their dog, Nacho.
